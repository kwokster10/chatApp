Guidelines for the lounge chatroom version 1.0:
    -Make your chatting experience more fun with these options (type as shown in lowercase and no quotes are needed)

1. Type /username and then a new one word username to change your current username. So it should look like this without the quotes: "/username newUsername".

2. Add color to your words for others to see with /color and either blue, green, red or yellow like so, also no quotes: "/color blue".

3. Need to make yourself heard, use /yell. Example, also no quotes needed: "/yell listen to me!"

4. Or for more dramatic effect, use the /tableflip function. This one you only need to type /tableflip

5. Feeling down? Ask the bot for a joke. Everyone gets to share the joke. Simply type "/humorUs". Did I mention you don't need the quotes.

6. When you decided you've had enough chatting for the day, simply hit 'control c' simultaneously to exit. 

7. Have fun, don't be a bully and hope to see you again while we are working on version 1.1 :).
